> [!NOTE]
> Some features of this app depend on the [HRMS](https://github.com/frappe/hrms) app. If you want to use them, you need to install the HRMS app before installing this app.

### On Frappe Cloud

You can find ERPNext Germany in the [Frappe Cloud Marketplace](https://frappecloud.com/marketplace/apps/erpnext_germany).
Please refer to the [Frappe Cloud documentation](https://frappecloud.com/docs/installing-an-app) on how to install an app.

### Local

Using bench, [install ERPNext](https://github.com/frappe/bench#installation) as mentioned here.

Once ERPNext is installed, add the ERPNext Germany app to your bench by running

```bash
bench get-app https://github.com/alyf-de/erpnext_germany.git
```

After that, you can install the app on required site (let's say demo.com ) by running

```bash
bench --site demo.com install-app erpnext_germany
```

## Business Trip

Before an employee can create a **Business Trip**, you should configure the available regions and their travel allowances in the **Business Trip Region** list.

When a **Business Trip** is submitted, it creates a draft **Expense Claim** for the employee's travel allowances. The **Expense Claim** can be approved and submitted as usual.

The receipts for transport and accommodation can be attached, but are not processed automatically. You can check them, create a **Purchase Invoice** and pay the respective amount to the employee.

You can use our [Banking app](https://github.com/alyf-de/banking) to reconcile the **Expense Claims** and **Purchase Invoices** with the respective **Bank Transactions**.
